## ** Data Pipeline**
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Merged **Customer, Loan, and Bureau Data** (~50,000 records).
   - Handled **missing values** & **categorical encoding**.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified **key risk factors** (Loan-to-Income, Credit Utilization).
   - **Class imbalance observed** → Addressed using **SMOTE-Tomek**.

3. **Model Training & Optimization**
   - Tested **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.
   - **XGBoost (Optuna-tuned) achieved the best performance**.

4. **Evaluation & Risk Segmentation**
   - **AUC-ROC = 0.984** → Excellent discrimination between risky & non-risky loans.
   - **Rank Ordering with Deciles** → Identified **top-risk customers**.

## ** Model Insights**
- **Top 10% customers (Decile 9 & 8) account for 98.6% of defaults.**
- **Loan-to-Income & Credit Utilization** are the most influential features.
- **AUC-ROC = 0.98** confirms the model's effectiveness in distinguishing risky borrowers.

---

## ** Future Improvements**
-  **Deploy model using AWS SageMaker for real-time predictions.**
-  **Automate data ingestion & risk scoring dashboard.**
-  **Enhance model with real-time streaming fraud detection.**
